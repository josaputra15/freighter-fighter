            You have 5 ships. They are precious. Your opponent also has 5 ships, which are evil
            and must be destroyed. They, however, will seek to destroy <i>your</i> precious 5 ships!
            End them.

        <p>
            Before the game starts, you'll have to place your ships onto the board. Click a ship on the small board to the left
            to pick it up. Then, click the square where you want to place it on the big board to the right. This will show you 
            where you can place it, as pictured below. Click any of the purple highlighted tiles to finish placing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use the number keys (1-5) to pick up ships. Use the arrow keys to navigate the placement board. Tiles will be highlighted aqua while
            selected (<img src="static/assets/instructions/highlighted2.png" alt="selected tile" class="embed">).
            Press enter to begin placing the ship, and then an arrow to indicate what direction you want it to go.
            You can press Escape at any time to de-select a ship. Press Ctrl+Enter when you're ready to start the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can press Escape to stop placing the ship. You can also select a ship you've already placed to move it
            somewhere else. Once the game starts, players will take turns. Once it's your turn, click a tile on the rightmost
            board to attack it! That will be your turn. You can see what your opponent has attacked via the
            board on the left.
        </p>

        <p>
            On your turn, click somewhere on the rightmost board, which shows where you've already attacked.
            If you don't hit anything, that tile will become a <img src="static/assets/miss.svg" alt="missed icon" class="embed">.
            If you hit a ship, you'll see a <img src="static/assets/hit.svg" alt="hit ship icon" class="embed">.
            And if you get the final blow on a ship, all of its tiles will turn into <img src="static/assets/destroyed.svg" alt="destroyed ship icon" class="embed">!
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of the mouse, you can also use the arrow keys to navigate your opponent's board. Tiles will be highlighted aqua 
            while selected (<img src="static/assets/instructions/highlighted2.png" alt="selected tile" class="embed">).
            Press enter to lock in your guess. On your next turn, your keyboard cursor will remain wherever it last was.
